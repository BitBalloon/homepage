## About BitBalloon

<p class="lead">BitBalloon is built by makers of <a href="http://www.webpop.com">Webpop</a>, a powerful cloud CMS platform for creating dynamic sites and webapps. BitBalloon packages performance optimization, forms handling and high performance infrastructure of Webpop into a highly focused service for static sites.</p>

### Why are you offering Hosting for Free?
Being able to __write__ to the internet, not just read it, is a basic human right.

Providing an easy place for anyone to upload their site directly onto the internet is our way of supporting this idea to become a reality.

We also want to give people a first hand experience of site optimization to raise awareness of web performance. Heavy, uncached websites are not only a huge waste of time and electricity, but they are also a major accessibility problem for billions of people with limited access to bandwidth. The web would be a whole lot faster if everyone correctly implemented the web performance best practices that BitBalloon automates.

Of course, a freemium modal also helps people discover our premium site offerings!

### How does BitBalloon make Websites so Fast?

We're simply doing all the stuff you __should__ be doing to make your websites fast. The problem is, that stuff is tedious & complicated. So we built a robot to do it!

Here are the performance optimizations performed by BitBalloon:

**Asset Compression** — BitBalloon compresses your CSS & JavaScript to make your site lighter. Any CSS files that are referenced next to each other in your html will get combined into a single compressed file. The same goes for your JavaScript.

**Image Optimization** — An image optimizer removes unnecessary meta data from your images so that they are lighter & load faster for your visitors, but still retain the same image quality.

**CDN Integration** — All of the assets that get optimized by BitBalloon are uploaded to Akamai, the largest and most advanced content delivery network in existence. This means your site will be hosted on hundreds of servers throughout the world so that your visitors get speedy access to your site from anywhere on the planet. It also means that Bitballoon sites can handle intense traffic spikes without skipping a beat.

**Perfect Caching** — Having perfect caching headers means that your site assets will be downloaded just once by your visitors and then stored offline in their web browser for instant access whenever a page they visit needs one of the cached assets.

### So my forms just work?

Yes! BitBalloon detects any HTML forms you have on your site and the stores submissions to those forms in your project dashboard. Premium sites can also send email notifications of the form submissions.

Each site also comes with an API that's modeled after Zapiers [perfect API](https://zapier.com/developer/perfect-api/), making it easy to send form submissions to hundreds of other cloud services.

### Why a Balloon?

We wanted to re-invent the whole experience of deploying optimized websites by making it fun & simple instead of unnecesarily complicated. We chose a balloon to represent this hosting service because like a balloon, a static site has no moving parts and derives it's virtue from being light, lighter than the air around it!
