![Fixie - THE MANHAPPENI from Solè](/img/posts/fixie.jpg)

Yesterday Paul Graham tweeted this little gem on static sites:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Static sites are the fixies of the Internet.</p>&mdash; Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/statuses/402205795552489472">November 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

Just as with fixies, part of the fascination with static sites is their simplicity, their light weight and the lack of maintenance.

There's a more derogatory part to the analogy though, hinting that static sites are a short-lived fad — unpractical but appealing to cyber-hipsters until the next trend comes along.

As a founder of a [hosting service for static websites](https://www.bitballoon.com), I obviously have a different view on this.

### Everything old is new again

Tech moves in cycles. Ever so often something old comes back again.

Smalltalk dropped out of the mainstream, but years later lots of the same ideas came back in the shape of Ruby. The world moved away from mainframes onto desktop PCs, but then the cloud came along and brought back a lot of the old centralized computer paradigms. Static websites got swept away by dynamic sites powered by scripting languages or CMS platforms, now we might be seeing another big come-back.

The basic appeal of a static website is easy to understand: there's no beating a static HTML document for performance, there's zero maintenance involved, scaling to large amounts of traffic is straight forward, the security issues that often plague dynamic sites are non-existent and they've proven to be future proof: the [first website ever made](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) works just fine in a modern browser.

There are also obvious reasons why dynamic sites became the norm. Editing HTML by hand quickly gets painful. It's fine for marking up a design, when actually working with content it's way to much overhead, and today it's impossible to imagine managing a large website in plain HTML without any way to avoid duplicating navigation elements, common headers and footers, sidebars etc, and manually generating list of most recent items, etc, etc. "Web 2.0" also brought a new focus on user-submitted content and social interactions, that didn't jive with static sites.

In recent years several things have changed that might be paving the way for the [revival of static](http://carrot.is/coding/static).

### Static sites are hardly as static as they used to be




Static sites are coming back because:

their virtues: fastest performance, no security issues, no maintenance, easy to understand and work with, no lock in, future proof - a static site from the dawn of the world wide web will still pretty much just work anywhere

static site generators: http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/, Jekyll, Octopress, Middleman, Punch, and many many more.

not so static anymore: A/B testing, comments, social widgets all bring static sites to life, and there's no backend needed. Even content management: Prismic, Osmek, Contentful

One page apps: Firebase, Parse, Stackmob or custom backend. Decouple the dynamic backend from the static front-end.
