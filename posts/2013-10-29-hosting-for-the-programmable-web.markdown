Hosting a website today is like renting an apartment without any utility hookups. Instead of just calling the power company to activate your account and flipping on the lights, you basically have to get out your electricians kit and climb up the telephone pole to hook into the power line yourself.

Unless you're a lineman, or can afford to hire one, you're gonna have a hard time participating and benefiting from the API Economy. We find this is completely unacceptable!

So we created BitBalloon to make it easy for anyone to publish a website or web-app onto a hosting environment that provides the core utilities of the programmable web, out-of-the box.

### Site Aware Publishing

What makes BitBalloon so different from other hosting platforms is that it's "site aware". When you drag and drop a site onto BitBalloon, the first thing that happens is that BitBalloon scans all your files to get an understanding of what you're actually hosting.

Once it has this contextual awareness of how your site works, BitBalloon essentially goes to work as your own personal robot lineman. It optimizes your code and media, makes any forms in your HTML work and hooks up an API which provides a plug and play interface between your site and the rest of the web.

### An on-ramp to the API Economy

The OAuth2 based API that BitBalloon hooks up for your site puts you in a good position to leverage the programmable web in a meaningful way, even if you don't know the first thing about HTTP!

BitBalloon's API is integrated with <a href="http://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a>, an API marketplace which lets you wire up business logic between your site and other web services with a point and click interface.

The combination of BitBalloon and Zapier means that instead of being forced to figure out how to implement some obscure network protocol, you're finally in control of telling machines what to do! Things that used to be hard, like hooking your forms into a CRM platform or making a service like Twillio send a text message when a submission comes in, become a trivial task.

### Open Platform

Our mission for creating much more accessible and API-driven hosting platform doesn't end with our end users. BitBalloon's underlying infrastructure is open for other developers to leverage in their own services.

If you're building web authoring tools, you can use BitBalloon's infrastructure to empower your users with "site aware", API-backed web publishing using your own brand!
